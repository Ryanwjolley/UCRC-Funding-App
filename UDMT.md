Utah Diversion Measurement & Telemetry Program
Application Portal Content
This document contains all the text content to build the UDMT Application Portal website.

The Utah Diversion Measurement and Telemetry Program (the UDMT Program) is a federally funded, collaborative initiative between the Upper Colorado River Commission (UCRC) and the Colorado River Authority of Utah (Authority) with support from Jones and DeMille Engineering (JDE). The intent of this Program is to enhance water monitoring infrastructure across the Upper Colorado River Basin within the State of Utah by installing real-time measurement and telemetry devices on diversion structures.

Additional information on the program can be found at the following link: http://www.ucrcommission.com/agencies-programs/utah-diversion-measurement-telemetry-program/

This application portal collects eligibility information, project details, water-rights/authority and supporting documents. Data from approved projects will be made publicly available through the Utah Division of Water Rights (DWRi) and the UCRC data portal as part of program requirements.

Jones and DeMille Engineering (JDE) has been contracted to support the UCRC in the implementation of the UDMT Program and is available to assist applicants in submitting applications for their proposed projects. Office locations and contact information are listed below. A PDF version of this application can be downloaded here, but all applications will be required to be submitted electronically. If an applicant needs assistance, please reach out to JDE for support.

Please note that UCRC may require applicants to submit additional information which goes beyond the scope of what is submitted with this application if the application cannot be fully evaluated without the additional information. UCRC may refuse to proceed with evaluating a proposed project if the requested additional information is not provided by the applicant. In addition, UCRC may reject an application for any or no reason allowed by law.

## 3) Roles & Onboarding

### Roles

* `user` — can create/edit their **own** drafts; submit; read-only after submission.
* `admin` — can view **all** applications, edit any Draft, and submit on behalf of a user.
* `superadmin` — all admin permissions + manage roles + archive.

### Bootstrapping Roles

* **Manual seed**: set `role: superadmin` on the designated initial account in Firestore before launch. Superadmin can then grant/revoke `admin` to others via an internal tool (or script).

### Authentication & Profile

* **Magic-link** (email link) via Firebase Auth.
* First sign-in prompts for **Full Name**; Terms/Privacy consent checkbox.
* Session: 30 days (silent refresh).

---

## 4) Lifecycle, Draft Editing, Duplication

### Application States

* `Draft` → `Submitted` (locked for applicants).

### Draft Editing Authority

* Applicants: edit only their own drafts.
* Admins: may edit **any Draft** and **Submit** on behalf of the applicant (record `submittedBy`).

### Audit Logging (Drafts)

* Field-level logs for every value change: `{ fieldName, oldValue, newValue, user, timestamp }`.
* Stored under `applications/{id}/auditLogs`.
* Applicant receives an **email** when admins edit their draft.

### Duplicate Behavior

* From a **Submitted** record, `Duplicate` creates a new **Draft** with all field values copied; `photos` cleared; `submissionDate` cleared; new `applicationId`; audit note: *Duplicated from {sourceId}*.

---

## 5) Information Architecture & Navigation

* **Multi-step wizard** with progress bar: Applicant Info → Project Details → Photos → Supporting Info → Review & Submit.
* **Auto-save** (debounced ~2s) + manual **Save Draft** button.
* Unsaved-changes guard on navigation/close.
* Applicant dashboard: *My Applications* table (Name/ID, Status, Last Updated; Actions: Create New, Edit Draft, View, Duplicate). Sorted by last updated desc.
* Admin draft editing uses the **same form UI** plus an admin banner and collapsible **Audit Log** sidebar.

---

---

## 29) Wizard Timeline — Step Completion Indicator

### Purpose
Indicate section completion in the wizard timeline by changing the step badge color:
- **Red** = incomplete (required items missing)
- **Green** = complete (all required items satisfied for that step)
- **Blue** = current step (overrides red/green while focused)

> No “in-progress/amber” state. A step remains **red until complete**.

### Behavior
- Evaluation runs on page load, route/step changes, debounced field changes (~300–500ms), and file upload success/delete.
- This indicator **does not block navigation**; final submission still uses **full-form validation**.
- A field hidden by conditional logic is **not required** for completion.

### Step completion rules
1. **Welcome** – mark green after viewed.  
2. **Eligibility** – all checkboxes must be checked.  
3. **Applicant Info** – required: Name, Phone, Mailing Address, Email. Program questions and follow-ups must be answered.  
4. **Proposed Project** – one project type selected; required fields for that type complete.  
5. **Location & Photos** – Latitude/Longitude present; trans-basin answered; at least one photo per bin.  
6. **Water Rights & Authority** – water right number and flow/volume present.  
7. **Self-Installation** – visible only when applicable; estimated cost and required uploads complete.  
8. **Review & Submit** – all certification boxes checked.

### Accessibility
- Each badge has an `aria-label` (e.g., “Step 3: Applicant Info — Complete”).
- Color plus symbol: ✓ for green, ! for red.

### UI details (Tailwind)
- Circular badges (`h-9 w-9 rounded-full`).
- Colors:
  - Red: `bg-red-600 text-white`
  - Green: `bg-green-600 text-white`
  - Blue (current): `bg-blue-600 text-white ring-2 ring-blue-300`

---

## 30) Admin & Applicant Impersonation (Prototype-Only)

### Purpose
Prototype feature for testing **Admin Draft Editing** and **View as Applicant** flows without separate logins.

### Feature Flag / Modes
- `PROTOTYPE_IMPERSONATION=true` enables role switcher.
- `EMAIL_MODE=mock` and `PDF_MODE=mock` by default.

### Seed Users
- **Admin**: `admin@example.com`  
- **Applicant A**: `applicantA@example.com`  
- **Applicant B**: `applicantB@example.com`

Each applicant seeded with one **Draft** and one **Submitted** application.

### Role Switcher
- Dropdown: `Admin`, `Applicant A`, `Applicant B`
- Changes `actingAs` context; updates permissions.
- Banner indicates impersonation mode.

### Banners
- Admin Mode: “You are Admin…”
- Applicant Mode: “Viewing as Applicant A…”
- “Exit Impersonation” button returns to Admin.

### Route Guards
- Applicant: view/edit own drafts.
- Admin: view/edit all drafts, submit on behalf.

---

## 31) Admin Draft Editing & Submit-on-Behalf

| Action | Draft | Submitted |
|---|---|---|
| View | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit fields | ✅ | ❌ |
| Upload/delete photos | ✅ | ❌ |
| Submit | ✅ | ❌ |
| Archive | ✅ | ✅ |

- **Submit confirmation modal**.
- **Audit log** for all edits and submissions.
- Emails/PDFs mocked or live per flags.

---

## 32) Prototype Test Scenarios
1. Admin edits a Draft → mock email logged.  
2. Admin submits on behalf → status `Submitted`; `submittedBy` set.  
3. Admin “View as Applicant” → correct permissions + banner.  
4. Applicant duplicates Submitted → new Draft, photos cleared.  
5. Step 5 turns green when lat/lng + photos filled.  
6. Admin archives → hidden from table.

---

## 33) Admin Page UI (Prototype)

- **Route**: `/submitted-forms`
- **Columns**: Applicant, Email, Project, Status, Dates
- **Filters**: Status, Date
- **Row Actions**:
  - Edit Draft
  - View
  - View as Applicant
  - Duplicate
  - Archive

Empty states for no results or drafts.

---

## 34) Acceptance Criteria — Admin Features
- Role switcher visible under prototype flag.
- Admin can edit and submit any Draft.
- Audit logs capture changes with impersonation flag.
- View-as-applicant renders correct restrictions.
- Archiving hides record (no hard deletes).

---

## 35) Map Integration — Leaflet

- **Street**: OpenStreetMap (`https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`)
- **Aerial**: Esri World Imagery (`https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}`)

### Validation
- Step 5 complete when:
  - `lat` & `lng` present
  - Trans-basin answered
  - ≥1 photo per bin

### Accessibility
- Toggle labeled “Street / Aerial”
- Live region announces coordinates.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Click map → marker placed, coords update.

## 37) Submit Button Validation Enhancement

### Implementation
The "Submit Application" button on the final wizard step (Review & Submit) now implements comprehensive validation to ensure data quality and completeness before submission.

### Validation Logic
- **Disabled State**: Button remains disabled until ALL required fields across ALL wizard steps are completed
- **Real-time Updates**: Button state updates automatically as users complete/modify form fields
- **Visual Feedback**: Disabled button shows reduced opacity (50%) and "not-allowed" cursor
- **Step Dependencies**: All 8 wizard steps must pass validation:
  1. Welcome: Always complete after viewing
  2. Eligibility: All eligibility checkboxes must be checked
  3. Applicant: Name, phone, mailing address, and email required
  4. Project: Project type, name, and water body name required
  5. Location: Latitude, longitude, and trans-basin diversion answer required
  6. Water Rights: Water right number and flow rate required
  7. Self-Install: Conditional validation based on project type
  8. Review: All final certifications must be checked

### Technical Implementation
- Uses existing `validateStepCompletion()` function in `lib/utils.ts`
- Tracks completion state via `allStepsCompleted` boolean derived from step validation array
- Prevents accidental submission of incomplete applications
- Maintains existing step completion indicators (red/green/blue badges)

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback on what needs completion via step progress indicators
- Prevents submission errors and ensures data quality
- Professional UX with proper accessibility attributes
- Consistent with existing app styling and behavior

## 38) Checkbox Standardization

### Implementation
Standardized all checkbox elements throughout the application to ensure consistent sizing, styling, and behavior across all wizard steps and components.

### Standardization Details
- **Consistent Size**: All checkboxes use `w-5 h-5` (20px × 20px)
- **New CSS Class**: Added `.checkbox-standard` utility class in `index.css`
- **Flex Behavior**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent checkboxes from shrinking when text wraps
- **Styling Consistency**: Unified focus states, border colors, and hover effects

### CSS Implementation
```css
.checkbox-standard {
  @apply w-5 h-5 text-primary border-gray-300 rounded focus:ring-primary flex-shrink-0;
}
```

### Applied Components
- **EligibilityPage**: All eligibility requirement checkboxes
- **ReviewPage**: All final certification checkboxes
- **Future-proof**: Standard available for any new checkbox implementations

### Benefits
- Professional, polished appearance
- Improved accessibility with consistent focus indicators
- Better responsive behavior on smaller screens
- Easier maintenance with centralized styling
- Enhanced user experience with predictable checkbox behavior
